# Game design planning

- day system
  - lighting changes at defined moments (after some events finish?)
  - ambient sounds change w/ time of day
  - different events can happen at diff times of day

- npcs
  - voice acted people w/ 3d audio
  - need a path they can walk on

- random scripted events
  - sequenced events (must follow order)
  - time-based events (certain time of day restriction)

- need a way to move and interact with items
  - hl2 style?

- simple interactables
  - bucket for items
  - way to open / close gate
  - bed for sleeping at night (wake up mid-night events?) (valheim-esque sleeping stuff?) (elapsed day tracker)

- king's decrees (update daily)

- newspaper (update daily)
